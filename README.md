# extrude-vertices-all-directions
A Blender tool that allows you to extrude selected vertices in all directions (X,Y,Z,-X,-Y,-Z).

You can set the amount and choose whether select created vertices or not. 
## How to install
Open up extrudeVerticesAllDirections.py in the Text Editor and _press Alt+P_
## How to use
1. Select a mesh object and toggle into Edit Mode (_Tab_)
2. In the MISC tab of the Tool Shelf (_T_) you'll find a new Extrude in all directions panel
3. Set the extrusion amount and whether select new vertices or not (if not, original vertices will still selected)

## TODO
1. Optimize code: Blender holds on when too many vertices selected
